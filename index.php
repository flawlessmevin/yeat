					<p class="small-h3">Yeat began his career in 2015, originally making music under the name Lil Yeat, but these
						releases have
						since been deleted from the Internet. On June 30, 2018, Yeat made his first public appearance under his
						current moniker, premiering a track called "Brink" on Elevator, a YouTube channel. Yeat has stated that he
						created the name Yeat while high and trying to come up with one word that sounds familiar to people. His
						stage name has also been described as a combination of "yeet" and "heat". Yeat has mentioned how his use of
						LSD was able to help him pursue his music career. He released his first mixtape, Deep Blue Strips on
						September 20, 2018. On February 21, 2019, he premiered the music video for his track "Stay Up" on
						Elevator.</p>

					<p class="small-h3">Yeat achieved viral success online through platforms such as TikTok in 2021. Writing for
						Pitchfork, Mano
						Sundaresan
						commented, "Cutting his teeth in the influential online rap collective Slayworld over the last few years,
						Yeat
						was
						always a little stranger than his peers, and consequently cast as a minor figure. But in 2021, his
						surrealist
						bent
						became his superpower." Yeat's music began to gain traction online following his 4L mixtape, which was
						released on June
						11, 2021. The 4L project notably included "Sorry Bout That" and "Money Twerk".</p>

				<div class="panel">
					<p class="small-h3">On September 2, 2022, Yeat released "Talk", a single from his EP Lyfe. The EP itself was
						released a week
						later on September 9, debuting and peaking at number ten on the Billboard 200. On October 21, he was
						featured on rapper YoungBoy Never Broke Again's song "I Don't Text Back", a track included on the latter's
						mixtape Ma' I Got a Family. On February 24, 2023, Yeat released his third studio album, Afterlyfe. The
						album includes a feature from YoungBoy Never Broke Again, in addition to Yeat's alter egos Kranky Kranky
						and Luh Geeky. It peaked at number four on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Billboard Rap Albums
						chart. On May 3, Yeat released the single "Already Rich"; the song, often referred to by the unofficial
						name "ard up", was originally leaked in 2021 and saw minor success on social media apps such as TikTok. On

				<p class="bio">
					From the start of his career, Yeat has utilized Auto-Tune-infused vocals. In 2021, he adopted a more
					aggressive
					and
					synth-based sound, joining a growing group of rappers that used "rage beats", a sound that became a
					SoundCloud
					staple
					influenced by the lively vocal deliveries and EDM-influenced beat selections of artists such as Playboi
					Carti,
					specifically on Whole Lotta Red. His vocal style has drawn comparisons to Playboi Carti, Future, and Young
					Thug.
					Yeat
					has stated the latter two are some of his biggest inspirations. He also cited American rapper T-Pain as one
					of
					his
					biggest influences growing up, calling him "The GOAT of Auto-Tune". Yeat's signature vocal preset is based
					on
					a
					vocal
					chain given to him by frequent collaborator and fellow musician Weiland.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-5">
				<p class="bio">Yeat has also been noted to employ a unique lingo in his music, coming up with ad-libs and
					phrases such as
					"twizzy",
					"krank", and "luh geeky", and often referring to luxury SUVs as "Tonka trucks" or "Tonkas" in his lyrics.
					His
					father was
					one of the inspirations for him creating these unique words, as he himself would make up his own words when
					Yeat
					was a
					child.

					Certain aspects of Yeat's music have led him to be associated with various Internet memes and trends,
					especially
					the
					frequent use of bell sounds in his music; an example being one of his breakout songs, "Get Busy", in which
					he
					raps
					"This
					song already was turnt but here's a bell" followed by the ringing of bells throughout the rest of the track.
